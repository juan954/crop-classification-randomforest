# crop-classification-randomforest
This my first Python project (2018) where I build a crop classification with random forests (python). 

We obtain the following:
  - Total accuracy
  - User accuracy
  - Producer accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Result image with predicted crops
  - Difference image where we compare the prediction to the truth image
  - Images containing the temporal evolution of the crops through the 2 months
